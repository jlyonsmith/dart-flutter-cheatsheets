[Dart Language Cheat Sheet](dart/Dart%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)

This repository contains cheat sheets for the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language and the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) UI Framework.

After using Flutter for some time I realized that there were no comprehensive cheat sheets for either Dart or Flutter.  All the ones that show up high in Google searches are often out of date or incomplete.

So, I've created a set of cheat sheets based on the following principles:

- It should fit on no more than one sheet of paper, utilizing both sides.  It's supposed to be a foldable desktop reference IMHO.
- It should give the highlights, not try to teach you the whole language, tool or framework. You still need to consult the documentation for the full semantics.
- It should be well organized, formatted in no more than three columns per side, and utilize an easy to read font.

Right now I'v used Apple Pages to create the cheat sheets. I may convert to Latex in future if it gets a lot of interest and people want to submit pull requests.

Please file an issue if you have suggestions for improvements or you spot bugs, typo's, or omissions.

## Dart

The [Dart Language Cheat Sheet](dart/Dart%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf) contains all the core features of the [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) page.

There's a shocking lack of up to date Dart programming language books on Amazon. In particular, a Dart reference that does not include [sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) is woefully out of date at this point.  The [Dart Specification](https://dart.dev/guides/language/specifications/DartLangSpec-v2.10.pdf) is a bit of a beast but is of course the definitive text on the language.

Other Dart cheatsheets:

- [Googles Dart Language Cheetsheet](https://dart.dev/guides/language/cheatsheet) - Promising, but it's too short, incomplete and not a printable cheat**sheet**.
- [Ray Wunderlich](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/08/RW-Dart-Cheatsheet-1.0.1c.pdf) - out of date, missing stuff and honestly a bit hard to read!
- [QuickRef](https://quickref.me/dart) - Again, more of a cheat-webpage, not a desktop reference.

## Flutter

Still working on the Flutter cheat sheet. Star the repo and check back soon!
